Description: This 'Rcpp'-based package implements highly efficient functions for the calculation of the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic. It can be used for a variety of applications, including feature selection in machine learning problems, or to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with multiple quantitative phenotypes. The code leverages 'OpenMP' directives for multi-core computing to reduce overall processing time.
